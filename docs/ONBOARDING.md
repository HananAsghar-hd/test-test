# Developer Onboarding Guide

**Project:** Test - Test

*Generated by Foundation Agent*

---

## Welcome

Test - Test is a comprehensive project management platform leveraging Azure cloud services, with a modern tech stack including FastAPI, React.js, and Kubernetes for scalable deployment.

### Key Contacts

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Tech Lead | Code reviews, architecture decisions |
| Project Manager | Sprint planning, stakeholder communication |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Installation |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Node.js | 18+ | `Download from nodejs.org or use package managers` |
| Docker | Latest | `Download from docker.com` |
| Git | Latest | `brew install git or equivalent` |

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository: git clone <repo-url>
2. Create environment variables: cp .env.example .env and update as needed
3. Install dependencies: npm install (frontend), pip install -r requirements.txt (backend)
4. Start local development servers: npm run dev (frontend), uvicorn main:app --reload (backend)

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# clone
git clone <repo-url>

# install_backend
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# install_frontend
npm install --prefix frontend

# start_backend
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# start_frontend
npm run dev --prefix frontend

# run_tests
pytest tests/ (backend), npm test --prefix frontend

```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production-ready code |
| `develop` | Integration branch for ongoing development |
| `feature/*` | Feature branches branched from develop |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fix branches |
| `hotfix/*` | Urgent fixes on main |

### Commit Conventions

**Format:** `type(scope): message`

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add new endpoint
fix(db): resolve connection issue
docs(readme): update setup instructions
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Commit changes and push
3. Open PR targeting develop
4. Request review and address comments
5. Merge after approval

### Code Review Guidelines

- Review within 24 hours
- Check code quality, standards, and tests
- Verify documentation updates
- Ensure no breaking changes

## Coding Standards

### Style Guide

Follow PEP8 for Python, Airbnb style for JavaScript

### Linting

Use flake8, ESLint, and Prettier configured in project

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:** All new functions must have unit tests
- **Integration Tests:** Cover API endpoints and critical flows
- **Coverage Minimum:** 80%

### Documentation Requirements

- Use docstrings for Python functions
- Update README for new features
- Maintain API docs with Swagger or OpenAPI

## Architecture Overview

Microservices architecture with FastAPI backend, React frontend, orchestrated via AKS, with Azure services for monitoring, logging, and storage.

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Frontend | React.js SPA with Redux and Material-UI |
| Backend | FastAPI microservices with SQLAlchemy ORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL with Redis caching and Elasticsearch for search |
| Infrastructure | Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure App Service, Blob Storage |

### Important Patterns

- Containerization with Docker
- CI/CD with Azure Pipelines
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Monitoring with Azure Monitor and Application Insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts during local startup**

Solution: Stop conflicting process or change port in environment variables

**Database connection errors**

Solution: Ensure Docker containers are running and environment variables are correct

### Getting Help

- Consult the documentation sections
- Ask questions in #development Slack channel
- Tag the Tech Lead for urgent issues
