## Executive Summary

The system is a lightweight, cloud-hosted project management portal supporting testing activities, client feedback, and opportunity tracking. It leverages Azure for hosting and AWS Credits for resource provisioning, emphasizing security, scalability, and ease of use.

### Key Decisions
- Adopt a microservices architecture for modularity and scalability
- Use Azure as the primary hosting platform with AWS Credits for resource management
- Implement RESTful APIs for system communication
- Prioritize security with role-based access control and encryption

### Technology Highlights
- Azure Cloud Platform for hosting and deployment
- React.js for frontend development
- FastAPI (Python) for backend API services
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Redis for caching
- Kubernetes (AKS) for container orchestration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- ELK stack for logging and monitoring

## System Architecture

**Architecture Style:** microservices

### Architecture Overview

The architecture comprises a frontend SPA hosted on Azure CDN, communicating via REST APIs with backend microservices deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Data is stored in PostgreSQL, with Redis caching. Client feedback portal and opportunity modules are separate services. Monitoring and logging are centralized with ELK stack.

### System Components

#### Frontend Web Application

**Purpose:** User interface for project management, feedback, and opportunity tracking

**Responsibilities:**
- Render dashboards
- Handle user interactions
- Communicate with backend APIs

**Technologies:** React.js, TypeScript, Redux

#### API Gateway

**Purpose:** Route requests to appropriate microservices and handle security/authentication

**Responsibilities:**
- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization enforcement

**Technologies:** NGINX or Azure API Management

#### Project Management Service

**Purpose:** Manage milestones, deadlines, progress

**Responsibilities:**
- CRUD operations for project milestones
- Progress tracking

**Technologies:** FastAPI, Python

#### Feedback Portal Service

**Purpose:** Handle client feedback and approvals

**Responsibilities:**
- Feedback submission
- Approval workflows

**Technologies:** FastAPI, Python

#### Opportunity & Financial Service

**Purpose:** Manage opportunity data and stages

**Responsibilities:**
- Opportunity CRUD
- Stage transitions
- Financial data management

**Technologies:** FastAPI, Python

#### Database

**Purpose:** Persistent storage of all system data

**Responsibilities:**
- Store project, feedback, opportunity data

**Technologies:** PostgreSQL

#### Caching Layer

**Purpose:** Improve performance for frequent read operations

**Responsibilities:**
- Cache project status, user sessions

**Technologies:** Redis

#### Container Orchestration

**Purpose:** Deploy and manage microservices

**Responsibilities:**
- Scaling
- Rolling updates
- High availability

**Technologies:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

#### Monitoring & Logging

**Purpose:** Ensure system health and security

**Responsibilities:**
- Collect logs
- Monitor system metrics
- Alerting

**Technologies:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Azure Monitor

### Data Flow

#### User Interaction

User interacts via frontend SPA, which sends REST requests to API Gateway. API Gateway routes to respective microservices, which interact with PostgreSQL and Redis as needed, returning data to frontend.

#### Feedback Submission

Client submits feedback via portal; data is stored in Feedback Service and persisted in PostgreSQL. Notifications sent via backend.

#### Opportunity Updates

Sales updates opportunity data; stored in Opportunity Service, with updates reflected in dashboards.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

**Framework:** React.js

*Justification:* React provides a flexible, component-based architecture suitable for dynamic dashboards and client portals, with strong community support.

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Redux | State management |
| Axios | API communication |

### Backend

**Framework:** FastAPI
**Language:** Python

*Justification:* FastAPI offers high performance, easy async support, and rapid development, ideal for microservices and REST APIs.

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| SQLAlchemy | ORM for PostgreSQL |
| Pydantic | Data validation |

### Database

**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL
*Justification:* Relational data with complex relationships, proven stability, and scalability.

**Caching:** Redis
*Justification:* Fast in-memory caching to improve response times and reduce database load.

**Search:** Elasticsearch
*Justification:* Optional, for advanced search capabilities if needed in future phases.

### Infrastructure

**Cloud Provider:** Azure
**Hosting:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
**CDN:** Azure CDN
**Storage:** Azure Blob Storage

### DevOps

**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
**Containerization:** Docker
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes (AKS)

**Monitoring:** Azure Monitor, ELK Stack

**Logging:** ELK Stack

### Third-Party Integrations

| Service | Purpose | API Type |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Azure Active Directory | Authentication and role-based access control | OAuth2 |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

**Method:** OAuth2
**Provider:** Azure Active Directory

### Authorization

**Model:** RBAC
**Implementation:** Azure AD roles and claims enforced at API Gateway and microservices

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest: Azure Storage encryption, PostgreSQL encryption
- Encryption in transit: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- Data masking: Sensitive data masked in logs and UI

**Compliance:** GDPR

### Security Measures
- Role-based access control
- Regular security audits
- Secure API gateway with rate limiting and IP filtering

## Scalability & Reliability
