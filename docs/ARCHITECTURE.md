## Executive Summary

The system will be a cloud-hosted web application on Azure, comprising modules for project management, client feedback, and opportunity tracking. It will be designed with a modular, scalable architecture supporting secure multi-user access, with emphasis on flexibility given the minimal initial scope.

### Key Decisions
- Adopt a microservices architecture for modularity and scalability
- Use Azure as the primary cloud platform for hosting and services

### Technology Highlights
- Azure Cloud Platform
- React.js for frontend
- FastAPI (Python) for backend APIs
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching
- Kubernetes (AKS) for container orchestration
- OAuth2/JWT for security

## System Architecture

**Architecture Style:** microservices

### Architecture Overview

The system consists of a frontend web application communicating via REST APIs with backend microservices for project management, feedback, and opportunity modules. Data is stored in PostgreSQL, with Redis caching. All services are containerized and deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). External integrations include Azure hosting and AWS Credits for resource management.

### System Components

#### Frontend Web Application

**Purpose:** User interface for project management, client feedback, and opportunity tracking

**Responsibilities:**
- Render UI
- Handle user interactions
- Communicate with backend APIs

**Technologies:** React.js, TypeScript

#### Project Management Service

**Purpose:** Manage project schedules, milestones, and hours

**Responsibilities:**
- Create/update schedules
- Track milestones
- Log hours

**Technologies:** FastAPI, Python

#### Feedback & Approval Service

**Purpose:** Facilitate client review, feedback, and approval workflows

**Responsibilities:**
- Collect feedback
- Track approval status

**Technologies:** FastAPI, Python

#### Opportunity Tracking Service

**Purpose:** Manage opportunity details and pipeline status

**Responsibilities:**
- Record opportunity info
- Update status

**Technologies:** FastAPI, Python

#### Database

**Purpose:** Persistent storage for all data entities

**Responsibilities:**
- Store project data
- Store opportunity data
- Store feedback logs

**Technologies:** PostgreSQL

#### Cache Layer

**Purpose:** Improve performance for frequently accessed data

**Responsibilities:**
- Cache project status, milestones

**Technologies:** Redis

#### Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Deployment environment

**Responsibilities:**
- Container orchestration
- Scaling
- Load balancing

**Technologies:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Load Balancer

### Data Flow

#### User Interaction

Client accesses the web app, which interacts with backend services via REST APIs to fetch/update project, feedback, and opportunity data.

1. User submits a request via frontend
2. Frontend calls appropriate backend API
3. Backend processes request, interacts with database/cache
4. Response is returned to frontend and displayed

#### Data Persistence

Backend services persist data changes to PostgreSQL and update caches as needed.

1. Backend receives data change request
2. Writes to PostgreSQL
3. Updates Redis cache
4. Confirms operation success

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

**Framework:** React.js

*Justification:* React provides a flexible, component-based architecture suitable for dynamic, responsive UIs; widely supported and developer-friendly.

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Redux | State management |
| Axios | HTTP communication |

### Backend

**Framework:** FastAPI
**Language:** Python

*Justification:* FastAPI offers high performance, easy API development, and async support, suitable for scalable microservices.

**Libraries:**

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| SQLAlchemy | ORM for database access |
| PyJWT | JWT token handling |
| OAuthLib | OAuth2 authentication |

### Database

**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL
*Justification:* Relational data with complex relationships, proven reliability, and strong support on Azure.

**Caching:** Redis
*Justification:* Fast in-memory cache to reduce database load and improve response times.

**Search:** Elasticsearch
*Justification:* Not prioritized initially; can be added later if search becomes complex.

### Infrastructure

**Cloud Provider:** Azure
**Hosting:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
**CDN:** Azure CDN
**Storage:** Azure Blob Storage

### DevOps

**CI/CD:** Azure DevOps
**Containerization:** Docker
**Orchestration:** Kubernetes (AKS)

**Monitoring:** Azure Monitor, Prometheus

**Logging:** Azure Log Analytics

### Third-Party Integrations

| Service | Purpose | API Type |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Azure Cloud Services | Hosting and cloud management | REST |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

**Method:** OAuth2 with JWT tokens
**Provider:** Azure AD B2C

### Authorization

**Model:** RBAC
**Implementation:** Role-based access control enforced at API level

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest via Azure Storage encryption
- Encryption in transit via HTTPS/TLS
- Data masking for sensitive info

**Compliance:** GDPR, ISO 27001

### Security Measures
- Secure API Gateway
- Regular security audits
- Least privilege access

## Scalability & Reliability

**Scaling Strategy:** Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory load
**Load Balancing:** Azure Load Balancer / Application Gateway

### High Availability

**Approach:** Multi-AZ deployment
**Failover:** Automatic failover with Azure Load Balancer
